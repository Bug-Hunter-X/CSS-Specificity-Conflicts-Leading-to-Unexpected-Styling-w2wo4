One common approach is to use the `!important` flag. However, overuse of `!important` is generally discouraged, as it makes your CSS harder to maintain and debug.  A better solution involves restructuring your CSS to make specificity conflicts less likely. For example, use more specific selectors from the start or refactor your CSS to reduce style conflicts.  You might also consider using CSS preprocessors that provide more advanced tools for managing style conflicts.
