This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug related to specificity conflicts.  The `bug.css` file shows the problematic CSS, while `bugSolution.css` offers a solution.  The bug arises when multiple selectors target the same element with different styles, and the browser must resolve which style to apply based on CSS specificity rules. Understanding and resolving these conflicts is crucial for maintaining predictable and consistent styling.
